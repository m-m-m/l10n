help=Synchronize localized resource-bundle properties from NlsBundle class(es) for the given locales.\nAll messages defined in the bundle class missing in the resource-bundle properties will be added with a TODO-marker followed by the original untranslated message.\nExisting properties that have already been translated before will be kept unchainged.\nMissing resource-bundle properties files will be created with all messages. After synchronization the translators can resolve all the TODOs and your localization is guaranteed to be in sync again.\nE.g. for foo.bar.NlsBundleMyExample and the locale zh_TW the file foo/bar/NlsBundleMyExample_zh_TW.properties will be created or updated in the configured path.
Path=Write properties-files in the specified base directory (default is "src/main/resources").
Locales=List of locales to synchronize. Each locale has to be provided in the format "ll[_CC[_vv]]", where "ll" is the ISO 639 code in lower case, CC is the ISO 3166 2-letter code in UPPER CASE and vv is an arbitrary variant. Examples are "de", "en_US" or "th_TH_TH".
BundleClasses=List of the NlsBundle-classes for which properties-files should be created or updated for the given locales. You have to provide the fully qualified name.
